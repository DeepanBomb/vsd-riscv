# VSD-RISC-V

This repository contains RISC-V based hardware design and experimentation work carried out as part of **VLSI System Design (VSD)** learning and projects. It focuses on understanding the RISC-V ISA, RTL implementation, simulation, and hands-on exploration of open-source processor design.

---

## Overview

**RISC-V** is an open-standard, free, and extensible Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) widely used in academia and industry.  
This repository serves as a practical workspace for:

- Learning RISC-V fundamentals
- Exploring RTL-level processor design
- Running simulations and test programs
- Building a strong foundation in open-source hardware

---

## Key Highlights

-  RISC-V ISA–based design and experiments  
-  RTL (Verilog/SystemVerilog) implementations  
-  Simulation and verification workflows  
-  Suitable for beginners and intermediate VLSI learners  
-  Built as part of VSD training / coursework
